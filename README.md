# HARP Coin Front-End

The HARP Protocol is a community driven, fair launched DeFi Token. Three simple functions occur during each trade: Reflection, LP Acquisition, and Burn.

We aim to enable blockchain and De-Fi integration for the mobile apps out there (focus is audio/music applications). Users simply will provide $HARP tokens to use the applications without ads thus we aim to create an economy around this idea

## Secure & Immutable

HARP is a smart contract based crypto which uses BEP-20 interface, making it secure and immutable.

## 100% Safe!

More than 84% of HARP is either burnt or reserved for public liquidity. AND LP is locked FOREVER! Please check the transaction event of locking LP [here on bscscan](https://bscscan.com/tx/0x7d56b419a16464bce56184aab105ac46a0eee456217e969274a4b27b720a9250#eventlog) and [here](https://bit.ly/3ediyKa)

## Community Driven

Community driven & fair launch. The dev team burned all of their tokens and participated with everyone else.

## Rewards holders through static reflection

Our tokenomics incentivize holding. We like to say "we pay you to hold". 5% of each transaction goes instantly and gaslessly to the HARP holders, proportional to their holdings.

## Automatic LP & Auto Staking

Every trade contributes towards automatically generating liquidity that goes into multiple pools used by exchanges. HARP is a deflationary token, HARP will be automatically staked just by holding it in your wallet, HARP wont let you down!

## Deflationary Black Hole. Forever!
Immediately after launch we burned more than 57% of the total supply of **HARP** and sent it to a dead wallet. Because the dead wallet is also a holder, it also gets proportional transaction rewards. But since nobody has access to that wallet, those **HARP** tokens are retired from circulation (effectively burned).
